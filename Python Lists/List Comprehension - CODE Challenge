A.Create a new list named double_nums by multplying each number in nums by two 
var1 = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
doublenums = [var2 * 2 for var2 in var1]
print(doublenums)

B.Youâ€™ve been given a list of the numbers between 0 and 10. We created this list using the range function!
#Create a new list names squares, that contains the square of every number in this list.
nums = range(11)

squares = [num ** 2 for num in nums]
print(squares)

C.Create a new list named add_ten that adds ten to every element in the list nums.
nums = [4, 8, 15, 16, 23, 42]
i = nums
add_ten = [i + 10 for i in nums]
print(add_ten)
